- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Fractal52
My main interest is using Python on various applications and platforms.
I have written some programs for my Raspberry Pi's and Windows 
I am also interested in 3D printing and have been working on a very basic 3D scanner for small objects.
I am learning and hope to use this platform to increase my knowledge and maybe pass on some of my work
